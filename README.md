## SQL Query Description

This SQL query is designed to analyze revenue and account metrics across different continents. It breaks down revenue by device type and calculates the percentage of total revenue contributed by each continent. Additionally, it provides insights into account creation and verification status per continent.

**The query utilizes the following Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**

1.  **`session_params_cte`**:
    * This CTE calculates revenue and session-related metrics, partitioned by `continent`.
    * It retrieves the `continent` from the `DA.session_params` table.
    * It calculates the total `revenue` for each continent using a window function that sums the `price` from the `DA.product` table.
    * It calculates `revenue_form_mobile` and `revenue_form_desktop` for each continent by conditionally summing the `product.price` based on the `device` type in `DA.session_params`.
    * It counts the total number of `session_count` for each continent using a window function on `session_params.ga_session_id`.
    * It also calculates the `total_revenue` across all continents using a window function without any partitioning.

2.  **`percent_revenue_from_total_cte`**:
    * This CTE calculates the percentage of the total revenue generated by each continent.
    * It selects the `continent` and calculates `percent_revenue_from_total` by dividing the `revenue` of each continent (calculated in the previous CTE) by the `total_revenue` and multiplying by 100.

3.  **`account_cte`**:
    * This CTE focuses on account-related metrics, grouped by `continent`.
    * It retrieves the `continent` by joining `DA.account`, `DA.account_session`, and `DA.session_params`.
    * It counts the total number of `account_count` for each continent.
    * It counts the number of `verified_account` for each continent by conditionally counting accounts where `account.is_verified` is 1.

**Finally, the main `SELECT` statement:**

* Retrieves the `continent` and all the calculated metrics from the three CTEs.
* It uses `DISTINCT` to ensure that each continent appears only once in the final result.
* It joins the `session_params_cte`, `percent_revenue_from_total_cte`, and `account_cte` on the `continent` column to combine all the relevant metrics for each continent.

**In essence, this query provides a comprehensive overview of revenue performance (overall and by device) and account activity across different continents.**
